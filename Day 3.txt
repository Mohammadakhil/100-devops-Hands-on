# #Day3 - DevOps Learning Journey

## âœ… What I Learned Today
1. Logged in to a remote server via SSH:
```bash
ssh tony@hostname

## Switched to the root user:
sudo -i

## Edited the SSH configuration file to secure root access:

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

## Restarted the SSH service and checked its status:

systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd


Key Takeaways

ssh username@hostname allows secure remote login to servers. Essential for managing servers remotely.
sudo -i switches to the root user with an interactive shell, giving full administrative access.
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config lets you modify SSH server settings. Securing SSH (e.g., disabling root login) is a critical security practice.
systemctl restart sshd applies changes to SSH configuration, and systemctl status sshd verifies the service is running properly.
Securing root SSH access is a fundamental step in server hardening and DevOps best practices.
