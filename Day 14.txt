# #Day14 - DevOps Learning Journey üõ†Ô∏è  

## ‚úÖ What I Learned Today  
Today‚Äôs task focused on **ensuring high availability of Apache services** across all app servers. A monitoring alert reported that the Apache service was down on one of the hosts, so I had to identify the faulty server, install Apache if missing, and make sure it was running on port **8087** on all app servers.  

I checked the service status using `systemctl status httpd`, installed Apache where necessary (`yum install httpd -y`), started and enabled the service to run on boot, and verified the listening ports with `netstat -tulnp`. I also updated the `httpd.conf` file to ensure the correct port configuration and confirmed availability with `curl http://localhost:8087`. By the end, Apache was up and running on all hosts, ensuring the system remained monitored and operational.

## üß† Key Takeaways  
- Monitoring alerts help quickly identify service outages across servers.  
- `systemctl status/start/enable` are essential commands for managing services.  
- Configuring the correct port in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` ensures services are accessible as expected.  
- `netstat -tulnp | grep httpd` helps verify which port Apache is listening on.  
- Ensuring services run consistently across all servers is critical for reliability in production environments.
