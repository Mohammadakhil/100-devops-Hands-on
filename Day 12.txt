# #Day12 - DevOps Learning Journey ⚙️  

## ✅ What I Solved Today  
Today’s task was all about **troubleshooting** — one of the most valuable real-world DevOps skills.  
The Apache service on one of our app servers wasn’t reachable on port **5003**, so I had to dig in to find out why.  
This kind of issue can arise from multiple sources — service downtime, port conflicts, or firewall misconfigurations — so systematic debugging was key.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting  

1. **Identify the faulty server**  
   Started by using `telnet` from the Jump Server to test connectivity across app servers and found **stapp01** was unreachable.  

2. **Access and elevate privileges**  
   ```bash
   ssh tony@stapp01
   sudo su -
#Check the Apache service status

systemctl status httpd
systemctl start httpd

#Checked the detailed status again to identify the reason for failure:
systemctl status httpd

#Resolve port conflict
Killed the conflicting process using its PID, freeing up port 5003.

#Restart and validate Apache

systemctl restart httpd
curl -I http://localhost:5003
