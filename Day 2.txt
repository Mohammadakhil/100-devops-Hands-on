##Day 2 - DevOps Learning Journey

## âœ… What I Learned Today
1. Created a new Linux user with an expiry date:
```bash
sudo useradd -e 2024-02-17 john

## Checked the current logged-in user:

echo $USER

Key Takeaways

useradd -e YYYY-MM-DD username creates a new user and sets an expiry date. After this date, the user cannot log in. Useful for temporary accounts or managing access.
echo $USER prints the username of the current logged-in user, helpful for verifying which account is active.
Managing Linux users is essential in DevOps for server access control and permission management.
