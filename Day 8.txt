## âœ… What I Learned Today
Installed a specific version of Ansible using `sudo pip3 install ansible==4.7.0` to ensure consistency across environments, verified the installation with `ansible --version`, and confirmed the installed version using `pip3 show ansible | grep Version`. This ensures that the exact version of Ansible is being used, which is important for avoiding compatibility issues in automation scripts and playbooks.

Key Takeaways

- `sudo pip3 install ansible==4.7.0` installs a specific version of Ansible, which is a popular automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation in DevOps.  
- `ansible --version` verifies that Ansible is correctly installed and shows the installed version along with Python and system paths.  
- `pip3 show ansible | grep Version` allows you to confirm the exact version of Ansible installed, ensuring compatibility with existing playbooks or roles.  
- Managing precise software versions is a key DevOps practice to maintain consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  
- Ansible enables infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing you to automate repetitive tasks, reduce manual errors, and improve deployment efficiency.
